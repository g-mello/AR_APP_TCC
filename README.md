## Description

This augmented reality app is part of my graduation assignment, which has been build using techologies such as the Game Engine Unity, the Vuforia SDK and the Autodesk Maya. The main intend of the project is create a mobile application, that assists the choosing and growing of ornamental plants at the Garden Centers, one of the reasons for that is the lack of information of what is the best way to grow each plant. The team of Vuforia has provided a nice feature called VuMark, which is a way to create a Data Base of the well known Fiducial Maker, but in a more branding approach. Using this kind of maker opens up the possibility of using brand logo to represent unique makers, beside the fact that it's easier for the user to look up them in the space.

## Why the use of Augmented Reality for this project ? 

This techonology has been known for such long time, but nowdays with the rise of, and ease access powerful mobile hardware there has been also ease ways to build this kind of applications for the day to day problems. One of its best potentials is the fact that put virtual information on our current known reality, make them get along pretty well. Therefore, augmenting our perception of the world around us, with information provided by virtually.

## The Application 

It's begins by looking for a registered VuMark in the scene, analyzing each frame of the camera. Then the data of Ornamental Plant is going to be retrived of the SQLite Database and the Main Menu UI is going to be loaded showing 5 Options: Plant, Soil, Water, Sun, How To Plant. Each one showing especific information about Plant, the last option is a guide to help the user to plant his choosing plant.
