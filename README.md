## Description

This augmented reality app is part of my graduation assignment, which has been build using techologies such as the Game Engine Unity, the Vuforia SDK and the Autodesk Maya. The main intend of the project is create a mobile application, that assists the choosing and growing of ornamental plants at the Garden Centers, one of the reasons for that is the lack of information about what is the best way to grow each plant. The team of Vuforia has provided a nice feature called VuMark, which is a way to create a Data Base of the well known Fiducial Maker, but in a more branding approach. Because there is the possibility of using brand logo to represent the Fiducial Maker.

One of its best potentials is the fact that put virtual information on our current known reality, make them get along pretty well. Therefore, augmenting our perception of the world around us, with information provided by virtually.
