## Description

This augmented reality app is part of my graduation assignment, which has been build using techologies such as the Game Engine Unity, the Vuforia SDK and the Autodesk Maya. The main intend of this project is to create a mobile application, that assists the choosing and the growing of ornamental plants by customers of Garden Centers. One of the reasons for that, is the lack of information about which is the best way to grow each plant.
<br>The Vuforia's team has provided a nice and solide feature called VuMark, which is a way to create a Data Base of unique Makers. Based upon these we can build up an Augmented Reality experience, in a sort of branding way. Using this kind of maker opens up the possibility of using brand logo along with unique indentification. It makes easier for the user to look the markers up in the real world space.
If you want to know more about VuMarks and the Vuforia you can reach out them with the following link : https://library.vuforia.com/articles/Training/VuMark

## Why the use of Augmented Reality for this project ? 

This techonology has been known for such long time, but nowdays with the rise of and ease access of powerful mobile hardware has introduded new ways to build up this kind of applications. One of its potentials is the fact of converging virtual information onto our currently known reality racking up a better for of reality. Therefore, augmenting our perception of the world around us, with information provided by the virtuality.

## Prototype and Mockups 

To accomplish the UX/UI process, MarvelAPP was used along side with the Adobe Photoshop, the link the final mockup can be found here: https://marvelapp.com/5di98i1

## The Application 

It begins by looking for a registered VuMark in the scene, analyzing each frame captured by the camera. Then the data of Ornamental Plant is going to be retrived on the SQLite Database and the Main Menu UI is will be loaded, showing 5 Options: Plant, Soil, Water, Sun, How To Plant. Each one showing especific information about Plant.
